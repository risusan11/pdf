        q: "Do you think governments should spend more money on space exploration?",
        a: "Yes, I think so. Space exploration helps people understand more about the universe and can lead to new scientific discoveries. When you answer, try to mention 'positive impacts' and give one clear example such as satellites or new materials."
      },
      {
        q: "Should schools ban the use of smartphones during class?",
        a: "Yes, I think so. Smartphones distract students from focusing on lessons. Mention concentration and academic performance. Or you can disagree by saying they can be used for learning apps."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you think people will be able to solve environmental problems in the future?",
        a: "Yes, I think so. Mention 'technology development' and give an example like renewable energy or electric cars. Remember to add 'In conclusion, I think this way of thinking is reasonable.' at the end."
      },
      {
        q: "Should companies allow employees to work from home?",
        a: "Yes, I think so. Working from home can save time and money, and help balance work and family life. You can also say 'the more flexible their work style is, the happier they will become.'"
      },
      {
        q: "Do you think technology will make people’s lives easier?",
        a: "Yes, I think so. Technology saves time and supports people’s daily activities. You can mention AI, online education, or transportation systems."
      },
      {
        q: "Should the government do more to reduce poverty?",
        a: "Yes, I think so. Poverty is a serious issue. You can say that supporting education and jobs will make society more equal and sustainable."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you think people rely too much on technology?",
        a: "Yes, I think so. You can mention how people use smartphones all the time and sometimes lose real communication. Add an example from your daily life to make it natural."
      },
      {
        q: "Should the government provide free college education?",
        a: "Yes, I think so. It gives equal chances to everyone regardless of income. But if you say no, you can argue that it would be too expensive for the government."
